## Function Size
- Keep Lambda functions small and single-purpose
- Prefer multiple Lambdas over a large monolith

## Timeout Management
- Always explicitly define timeouts
- Fail fast when the expected work cannot be completed in time

## Stateless Logic
- Avoid local or global state
- Use external stateful systems

## Cold Start Minimization
- Bundle dependencies carefully
- Avoid importing unused packages
