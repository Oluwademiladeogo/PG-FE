## Lazy Imports
- Import heavy libraries only when needed

## Optimize DB Calls
- Minimize number of queries per request
- Use `select` and `include` in Prisma to fetch only required fields

## Concurrency
- Use async/await properly to maximize concurrency
- Avoid blocking synchronous calls

## Monitor Lambda Metrics
- Track cold starts, memory usage, and execution time
