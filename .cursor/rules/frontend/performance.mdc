## Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports (`React.lazy`) for heavy components

## Debounce Inputs
- Use `use-debounce` for search boxes and fast-typing inputs

## Avoid Re-renders
- Memoize components with `React.memo` and `useCallback` where needed

## Bundle Optimization
- Monitor bundle size and use tree-shaking compatible packages
