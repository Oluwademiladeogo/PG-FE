## Functional Components
- Use function components and hooks instead of class components

## Controlled Components
- Always use controlled components for forms

## useEffect Cleanup
- Always clean up side effects in `useEffect`

## React Query
- Use `react-query` for async state where applicable
- Cache responses with appropriate stale time
