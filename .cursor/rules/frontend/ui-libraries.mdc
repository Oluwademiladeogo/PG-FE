description: Guidelines for using Tailwind, HeadlessUI, Heroicons, etc.
---

## Tailwind Consistency
- Use utility classes over custom CSS
- Abstract repeated classNames into reusable components

## Accessibility with HeadlessUI
- Ensure components have `aria-*` attributes and keyboard support

## Heroicons Usage
- Use SVG-based icons for accessibility and performance
